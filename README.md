European football and FIFA Players - A Data Mining approach

# âš½ Exploring Patterns in European Football & FIFA Players  

A data mining approach to uncover trends in player attributes, team performance, and match outcomes.  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project analyzes European football data using:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identifying trends and insights.  
- **Hypothesis Testing** â€“ Statistical validation of key observations.  
- **Clustering** â€“ Grouping players based on attributes.  
- **Association Rules** â€“ Finding patterns in player and team characteristics.  
- **Deep Learning** â€“ Regression & classification using PyTorch/Keras for performance prediction.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
- **Module A:** Data preprocessing, EDA, clustering, association rules.  
- **Module B:** Deep learning models for player rating prediction & classification.  

## ðŸ”§ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyankA-2701/Data-Mining.git
   ```

2. Run Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
- Home teams have a **strong advantage** in match results.  
- **Cluster analysis** reveals player archetypes based on skills like dribbling & finishing.  
- **Deep learning models** predict player ratings with high accuracy (~96%).
